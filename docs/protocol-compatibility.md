# Protocol Compatibility

CoKit tracks `codex app-server` as an upstream JSON-RPC protocol.

## Versioning

- CoKit library versions follow semantic versioning for public Kotlin APIs.
- Protocol schema metadata records the app-server schema generation command.
- Generated schema outputs are not produced during normal `check`; they are
  generated only when the schema task is explicitly invoked.

## Stable And Experimental APIs

Stable APIs should be available without special opt-in. Experimental APIs should
require explicit Kotlin opt-in annotations and app-server initialization
capabilities where upstream requires them.

The WebSocket transport is currently marked experimental because upstream marks
that transport as experimental.

## Schema Generation

Run:

```bash
./gradlew :cokit-protocol:generateCodexSchema
```

This task runs both stable and experimental schema generation modes:

```bash
codex app-server generate-json-schema --out build/generated/codex-schema/stable
codex app-server generate-json-schema --out build/generated/codex-schema/experimental --experimental
```

The command requires a local `codex` executable.

## Fixture Policy

Protocol fixtures should come from upstream examples, generated schema samples,
or reduced examples that exercise specific parser behavior. Fixtures must not
include secrets, access tokens, private account data, auth URLs, or private local
paths.
