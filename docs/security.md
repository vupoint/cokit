# Security

CoKit is a client library for an app-server that can request filesystem access,
command execution, permission changes, and other sensitive operations. Consumers
must treat app-server requests as security-sensitive.

## Approval Defaults

When no handler is registered, CoKit declines approval-like server requests by
default. This prevents a client from silently allowing command execution, file
changes, permission grants, dynamic tool calls, or elicitation flows.

Applications should register explicit handlers only when they can show the
request to a user, apply a policy, or otherwise make an intentional decision.
Prefer typed handlers such as command, file-change, and permission approval
handlers over raw method-string compatibility hooks.

Command execution approval requests are deny-by-default. Without a registered
command approval handler, CoKit responds with `{"decision":"decline"}` without
attempting to approve or execute the command. With a typed command approval
handler, CoKit decodes the upstream params before invoking application code.
Malformed params return JSON-RPC `-32602` and do not call the handler. Handler
exceptions return JSON-RPC `-32000` with a generic failure message so exception
text is not sent back to app-server.

File-change approval requests are deny-by-default. Without a registered
file-change approval handler, CoKit responds with `{"decision":"decline"}`
without approving the patch or granting write access. With a typed file-change
approval handler, CoKit exposes the request ids, optional reason, and optional
host `grantRoot` as typed values before encoding the handler's explicit
decision. Handler failures use the same generic JSON-RPC error behavior as
command approvals.

Permission approval requests are deny-by-default. Without a registered
permission approval handler, CoKit responds with `{"permissions": {}}`, which
grants no requested filesystem or network permissions. With a typed permission
approval handler, CoKit exposes the request ids, optional environment id,
request directory, reason, and requested permission profile as typed values.
Handler responses must return only the granted subset of requested permissions.
`PermissionGrantScope.Session` encodes `scope: "session"` for the app-server
session approval cache; `PermissionGrantScope.Turn` keeps the grant scoped to
the current turn. Malformed params and handler failures use the same JSON-RPC
error behavior as command approvals.

User-input prompt requests are cancel-by-default. Without a registered typed
user-input request handler, CoKit responds with `{"decision":"cancel"}` and
never fabricates prompt answers. With a typed user-input request handler, CoKit
exposes the request ids, prompt headers, question text, choice options,
free-form flags, secret flags, and optional auto-resolution timeout before
invoking application code. Handler responses must return either typed cancel or
explicit answer maps keyed by question id. Malformed params and handler failures
use the same JSON-RPC error behavior as command approvals.

MCP elicitation requests are decline-by-default. Without a registered typed MCP
elicitation handler, CoKit responds with `{"action":"decline","content":null}`
and never supplies structured form content or opens URL flows on behalf of an
application. With a typed MCP elicitation handler, CoKit exposes the server
name, thread id, optional turn id, message, and either a typed form schema or a
URL elicitation target before invoking application code. Application policy owns
all user decisions and should treat MCP-provided text, URLs, and requested form
fields as untrusted input. Handler responses must return explicit accept,
decline, or cancel actions. Malformed params and handler failures use the same
JSON-RPC error behavior as command approvals.

Attestation generation requests are unsupported by default. Without a registered
typed attestation handler, CoKit responds with `{"status":"unsupported"}` and
never creates or fabricates an attestation token. Applications that provide
upstream attestation must opt into `capabilities.requestAttestation`, register an
explicit attestation handler, and return only an opaque client-owned token in the
`token` field. Malformed params and handler failures use the same JSON-RPC error
behavior as command approvals.

## Host Semantics

Paths, commands, process APIs, and filesystem APIs refer to the app-server host.
That host may be different from the Kotlin client process host in remote-control
or proxy scenarios.

`CodexRpc.Command.Exec` sends an argv vector to the app-server for execution
under the server's sandbox policy. The `cwd`, environment overrides, timeout,
output cap, process id, PTY size, and sandbox policy fields describe host-side
execution only; they do not run commands in the Kotlin client process.
`CodexRpc.Command.WriteStdin`, `Resize`, and `Terminate` target the same
connection-scoped app-server process id supplied by `command/exec`; stdin chunks
are base64-encoded by the caller before they cross the protocol.
`CodexNotification.CommandExecOutputDelta` exposes base64-encoded stdout and
stderr chunks plus `capReached` when `outputBytesCap` truncates a stream. Callers
should choose sandbox policies deliberately, treat decoded command output as
untrusted, and avoid passing secrets in argv, stdin, environment overrides,
working directories, or captured output.

`CodexRpc.Process.Spawn`, `WriteStdin`, `Kill`, and `ResizePty` expose
experimental standalone process lifecycle methods. Upstream marks this surface
unsandboxed: these descriptors target the app-server host directly and are not a
replacement for sandboxed `command/exec`. Process handles are caller-supplied
and connection-scoped; stdin chunks are base64-encoded by the caller before they
cross the protocol. Applications should keep process APIs behind explicit user
or policy decisions, avoid shell interpolation, avoid passing secrets in argv,
stdin, environment overrides, working directories, or captured output, and treat
all output and exit notifications as untrusted host data.

`CodexRpc.Filesystem.ReadFile`, `GetMetadata`, and `ReadDirectory` inspect
absolute paths on the app-server host, not paths on the Kotlin client process.
`ReadFile` returns base64-encoded file contents, and `ReadDirectory` returns
direct child names rather than absolute paths. Applications should treat all
returned paths, metadata, and file contents as untrusted host data and avoid
requesting private files unless an explicit user or policy decision allows it.
`CodexRpc.Filesystem.WriteFile`, `CreateDirectory`, `Copy`, and `Remove` mutate
the app-server host filesystem. Exposing these descriptors does not approve
side effects or grant permissions; applications should call them only after an
explicit user or policy decision and should rely on app-server sandbox and
permission enforcement for the active session.
`CodexRpc.Filesystem.Watch` and `Unwatch` manage connection-scoped app-server
host filesystem watch subscriptions by caller-provided watch id. Watch responses
return the canonicalized host path, and `CodexNotification.FilesystemChanged`
reports only the watch id and changed host paths; it does not include file
contents or an event-kind field. Applications should treat changed paths as
untrusted host data, debounce or re-read state as needed, and unwatch paths when
the subscription is no longer needed.

`CodexRpc.Config.Read` reads the effective app-server configuration for an
optional host `cwd` and may include layer metadata when requested. CoKit keeps
arbitrary config values behind `ConfigValue`, which wraps `CodexJsonPayload`,
because the upstream config object is intentionally broad and forward
compatible. `CodexRpc.Config.WriteValue` and `BatchWrite` mutate the app-server
host config file selected by app-server or by an explicit `filePath`.
`BatchWrite.reloadUserConfig` asks app-server to hot-reload the updated user
config into loaded threads after writing. Exposing these descriptors does not
approve config edits or policy changes; applications should show the target key
path, file path, merge strategy, expected version, and reload behavior to a user
or policy engine before calling them.

`CodexRpc.Skills.List` reads skill metadata and parse errors for app-server host
working directories. CoKit treats returned skill names, paths, descriptions,
interface metadata, and dependency declarations as untrusted data and does not
execute skill content or render skill UI. `CodexRpc.Skills.SetExtraRoots`
changes the app-server skill search roots, and `CodexRpc.Skills.WriteConfig`
changes a skill's effective enabled state by name or host path. Applications
should show root paths, skill selectors, and enablement changes to a user or
policy engine before calling these mutation descriptors, especially when extra
roots point outside the active project.

`CodexRpc.Hooks.List` reads hook metadata, source paths, warnings, and parse
errors for app-server host working directories. Hook commands, matchers, plugin
ids, hashes, and status messages are untrusted catalog data in CoKit; the
library does not execute hook handlers or make trust decisions from this
descriptor. `CodexRpc.Apps.List` is experimental and reads app catalog metadata,
branding, labels, install URLs, and plugin display names for presentation by the
calling application. CoKit does not render app UI, authenticate apps, install
plugins, or invoke app behavior through the catalog descriptor.

`CodexRpc.Plugin.List`, `Installed`, `Read`, and `ReadSkill` expose plugin
marketplace data, plugin source metadata, app summaries, hook summaries, skill
summaries, MCP server names, and optional skill file contents. CoKit treats this
data as untrusted catalog content and does not load plugins, execute plugin
code, run plugin hooks, or authenticate app integrations from read descriptors.
`CodexRpc.Plugin.Install`, `Uninstall`, and the `CodexRpc.Marketplace` mutation
descriptors may change local plugin or marketplace state through app-server.
Applications should show source URLs, sparse paths, marketplace names, plugin
ids, install auth policy, apps needing auth, and installed roots to a user or
policy engine before invoking them.

`CodexRpc.Mcp` descriptors expose configured MCP server names, OAuth login URLs,
auth status, server presentation metadata, resources, resource templates, tool
definitions, resource contents, and tool-call results as untrusted protocol
data. CoKit preserves MCP-provided schemas, annotations, content arrays, tool
arguments, structured content, and `_meta` fields as `CodexJsonPayload` values
for compatibility, but it does not authenticate MCP servers, open OAuth URLs,
render connector UI, approve connector trust, or interpret tool results.
Applications should present the server name, resource URI, tool name, OAuth URL,
and any raw MCP payloads to a user or policy engine before initiating login,
reading resources, or calling tools.

## Secrets

CoKit should not log secrets by default. Consumers should avoid logging:

- API keys.
- Access tokens.
- Auth URLs.
- Attestation tokens.
- Private file paths when logs may leave the machine.

## Sandbox And Permissions

Sandbox and permission profile values are passed through to app-server. CoKit
does not weaken or reinterpret upstream sandbox semantics. Application-level
policy should make approval decisions explicit and visible.
`CodexRpc.PermissionProfile.List` only reports server-advertised permission
profile identifiers and descriptions for an optional host `cwd`; it does not
grant those permissions. `CodexRpc.CollaborationMode.List` and
`CodexRpc.Environment.Add` are experimental. Collaboration modes are server
presets, and environment registration passes an environment id plus execution
server URL through to app-server. Applications should keep these experimental
surfaces behind explicit opt-in and policy review, especially when registering
remote execution endpoints.

## Experimental Transports

The WebSocket transport is experimental. Use stdio for the default local
integration path unless an application has a specific reason to opt into
WebSocket behavior.
